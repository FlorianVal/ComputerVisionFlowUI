# Computer Vision Flow 🚀🔍

Welcome to the **React Computer Vision Flow** project! 🚀

This project is a web UI built with React that allows you to create a computer vision flow by connecting various nodes, each representing a common computer vision algorithm such as Canny edge detection, erosion, dilation, and color change. The output of the flow can be seen in real-time, making it an incredibly powerful and intuitive tool for computer vision development. 🔍

One of the key features of this project is that it is written entirely in React, making it easy to integrate into existing web projects. Additionally, the underlying logic is powered by Go code wrapped in WebAssembly, allowing for efficient performance right in the browser. 💻

This project can be used for a variety of computer vision tasks, such as:

- Object detection and tracking 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️
- Image segmentation 🖼️
- image preprocessing ⚙️
- And more! 🚀

With this project, you'll be able to create powerful computer vision flows with minimal code, and have the results available in real-time. 🕰️

To get started with the project, simply clone the repository and run the following commands:

    yarn install

    yarn start 

This will start a development server and you'll be able to access the application at `http://localhost:3000`. 🚀

We're excited to have you join the community of contributors making this project even better! 🤝

Happy coding! 🎉
